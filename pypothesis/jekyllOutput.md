[Retweeting and Comprehension](https://hapgood.us/2016/04/12/retweeting-and-comprehension/)

> the nature of the stream is it pushes you away from comprehension and into rhetoric. Rather than seeking to understand, the denizen of the modern Twitter or Weibo feed seeks to sort incoming information as right or wrong, helpful or unhelpful, worth retweeting or not retweeting, worth getting into a righteous rage about or not

[Open Source is losing, SaaS is leading, APIs will win… — Point Nine Land — Medium](https://medium.com/point-nine-news/open-source-is-losing-saas-is-leading-apis-will-win-663648d9c8d0)

> APIs are building blocks of software by definitionCompared with SaaS, by nature, they are platforms that allow development on top of them.It brings back the nature of “building block” that open source has and SaaS lost.API’s businesses focus on solving “smaller” problems but hard to crackFor that reason, there are higher chances that customers will trust an API provider for their core infrastructure.“If this is the only thing those guys do, there’s high chances they will do it better than myself”.

This idea of APIs blending the best (business models) of open source and SaaS is intriguing.

[How to write a good blog post  - Om Malik](http://om.co/2016/03/26/how-to-write-a-good-blog-post/)

> start with the basic premise: respecting your  reader’s time. Can they find the story somewhere else, and if yes, then WHY should they read you? What makes what you want to publish so special? Remember, readers have a million choices, to find information. They are better equipped than you. So why should they come to you? What is it that you got that others don’t?

>  If we don’t like ‘the system’ of ed-tech, we should create one of our own.    It’s actually not beyond our reach to do so.

Yes!

> Our challenge remains – in indie music and in indie scholarship and in indie ed-tech – to make this path one that is economically and emotionally sustainable.

If we don't, then indie/ open become the domain of the elite and privileged.

> what I do now – write about education technology – has nothing to do with what I studied formally as an undergraduate or a graduate student. But if nothing else, there I learned how to be a critical thinker, a thoughtful researcher, and a decent writer – and I’d contend that no matter what major you pursue in school, these are the sorts of skills all students should, ideally, come away with.

That's what education *should* be.

[Unleashed](http://musicfordeckchairs.com/blog/2016/03/16/unleashed/)

> Simply saying competition is divisive won’t raise standards for collaboration, and won’t create the grounds for hope. To do this, we urgently need to start collecting new stories and evidence of a different culture forged in kindness, that we know we can build together. Then maybe we need to start making our own videos.

Yes.

[Stress and The Kindness of Strangers](https://academicirregularities.wordpress.com/2016/03/10/stress-and-the-kindness-of-strangers/)

> I told them you could work 60 hours a week, never take a holiday or weekend off, have internationally regarded publications – lots of them, write textbooks, be a great teacher, and managers will still ask for more. And more. I told them you are measured only by what you have not managed to achieve, not what you have achieved, never mind how valuable or prestigious.

Unfortunately, this is how academics assess their students, too.

>  In effect, the status of an academic has slid from institutional asset to indentured servant. 

This is unsustainable, and is already leading to good academics leaving the academy.

> And so the answer to the question “Why is Twitter so culturally complex?” is that it’s the wrong question. It’s Facebook that is the weird thing here, a community that doesn’t develop an overall culture overtime.
