I can buy that. Though I do maintain that there are some fundamental differences in the networked structure of contemporary digital media that require new approaches. Connectivism has something to say here, but still not sufficient without thinking about how all these things intersect in ways we haven't faced historically.

Yes! Though it seems like there is a greater diversity of voices, there has been so much corporate conglomeration that there are only a few (or even one or two) big companies in each industry that control most of the message. Big problem.

Mike Caulfield has been blog-storming lately about the specific ways in which fake news, in particular, shared on social media shapes the way we think...and vote. https://hapgood.us/

It's amazing how many different funding models are possible on the web, and big news outlets still rely on advertising. There *are* other models possible, but the same advertiser-network-journalist connection is still there.

This sums up so much about the internet for me. So many great potentials -- even (especially?) on social media. And yet, Netflix encompasses 1/3 of web traffic, and [Facebook spreads fake news more readily than real news](https://hapgood.us/2016/11/13/fake-news-does-better-on-facebook-than-real-news/). We need the internet to inspire and illuminate, not just innoculate and misinform.

I've heard a similar explanation, but it goes industry -> information -> attention. I think the idea that we're in an attention economy, where the moderating of one's own attention and the competing for the attention of others are paramount. I think that makes more sense of where we are now.

> And now the machines are going to be producing a set of answers and we’ll have to say, Yeah, all I know is this thing does math better than me, so if it says this is true, it’s probably true.

Data scientists don't stop at "the machine knows". If the machine "knows" something they don't, it's that much more motivation to learn why! Curiosity isn't dead. Not for students, not for instructors, not for data scientists. If there's a problem here, it's that lectures and instructor demos don't pique curiosity. Pique students curiosity, and give them the resources and support they need, and amazing things can happen!

> There’s a mismatch between what the professors are trying to get them to do, which is really understanding, and what the kids are trying to do, which is to know it. You can’t fight history — they are moving to a world of knowing, not understanding.

This is not at all my experience. When motivated, my students really work hard to grok stuff.

Interesting. Who has the agency here? (I think calling adult students "kids" reduces the expectation of agency even more.)

> re-engineer themselves

The verb "engineer" here is telling. Nothing against engineers at all, but there are many other professionals that create and design. Why not "recreate", "redesign", "reform"? And while we're at it, why aren't "re-humanist" and "re-artist" verbs? What is it about engineer?

> Insisting on the glamour and fun of coding is the wrong way to acquaint kids with computer science. It insults their intelligence and plants the pernicious notion in their heads that you don’t need discipline in order to progress. As anyone with even minimal exposure to making software knows, behind a minute of typing lies an hour of study.

No, it began well before that. If any event precipitated it, it was the translation of parts of the Bible into English.
